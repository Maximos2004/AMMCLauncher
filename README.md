# AMMCLauncher
An Open Source Minecraft Launcher exercise to see how they can be made

# Info
- You can create and download multiple Minecraft Instances and choose which one to play

- You can select Minecraft Version when creating an Instance (with toggles if you want access to Betas and Snapshots)

- You can sign in with a Microsoft account and able to play Minecraft Online (You can also play MC without Sign In but you can only play Offline)

- Uses CmlLib 3.3.10 (I used mostly AI (ChatGPT and Gemini 2.5 Pro) and this is the latest version LLMs code is viable, but it also means I have no documentation on it)

- Forge Installation doesn't work, couldn't make it work.

# Dev Note

This is the end of this project. If I am gonna try again to make an MC Launcher is going to be with the Latest version of CmlLib having no documentation and relying on AI 100% doesn't work mostly cause it doesn't know everything and I can't guide it since it is suppose to teach me, but it hellucinates a lot. If I find a way to feed the LLM the gitbook of CmlLib or the AI gets smarter I will come back with a new MC Launcher :>
